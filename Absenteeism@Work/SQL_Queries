SQL Queries I used in this project:

Q1 - joins all tables on relevant columns:

SELECT * 
FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a
LEFT JOIN dbo.Reasons AS r
ON a.Reason_for_absence = r.Number
LEFT JOIN dbo.compensation AS c
ON a.ID = c.ID

Q2 - Find top 100 healthiest workers with the least absents

SELECT TOP 100
a.ID,
a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours
FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a
WHERE a.Social_drinker = 0 
AND a.Social_smoker = 0 
AND a.Body_mass_index BETWEEN 18 AND 25
AND a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours < (SELECT AVG(a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours) FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a)
GROUP BY a.ID,
    a.Body_mass_index,
    a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours
ORDER BY a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours ASC
