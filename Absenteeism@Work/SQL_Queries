SQL Queries I used in this project:

Q1 - regular example for join all tables on relevant columns:

SELECT * 
FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a
LEFT JOIN dbo.Reasons AS r
ON a.Reason_for_absence = r.Number
LEFT JOIN dbo.compensation AS c
ON a.ID = c.ID

Q2 - Find the healthiest workers with the least absents to give the bonus to

SELECT a.ID,
a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours,
a.Body_mass_index
FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a
WHERE a.Social_drinker = 0 
AND a.Social_smoker = 0 
AND a.Body_mass_index BETWEEN 18 AND 25
AND a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours < (SELECT AVG(a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours) FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a)
GROUP BY a.ID,
    a.Body_mass_index,
    a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours
ORDER BY a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours ASC

Q3 - Increase compensation for non smokers, 
first find how many non smokers:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_smokers 
FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a
WHERE a.Social_smoker = 0;

next using simple math we got a total of 686, 
working 8h/day over 5*52 days a year that is 8*5*52*686 = 1,426,880 Hours
and we need to divide the bonus between them of 967,345$ 
therefore each employee gets about an additional 2/3$ an hour which translated roughly to 1400$ a year per employee!

Q4 - Query for dashboard in PowerBI:

SELECT a.ID,
r.Reason,
a.Month_of_absence,

CASE WHEN a.Month_of_absence IN (1, 2, 12) THEN 'Winter'
WHEN a.Month_of_absence IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
WHEN a.Month_of_absence IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
ELSE 'Autumn'
END AS season,

a.Body_mass_index,
CASE WHEN a.Body_mass_index < 18.5 THEN 'Underweight'
WHEN a.Body_mass_index BETWEEN 18.6 AND 24.9 THEN 'Healthy'
WHEN a.Body_mass_index BETWEEN 25 AND 29.9 THEN 'Overweight'
ELSE 'Obese'
END AS BMI_Range,

a.Day_of_the_week,
c.comp_hr,
a.Transportation_expense,
a.Education,
a.Son,
a.Social_drinker,
a.Social_smoker,
a.Pet,
a.Disciplinary_failure,
a.age, 
a.Work_load_Average_day,
a.Absenteeism_time_in_hours
FROM dbo.Absenteeism_at_work AS a
LEFT JOIN dbo.Reasons AS r
ON a.Reason_for_absence = r.Number
LEFT JOIN dbo.compensation AS c
ON a.ID = c.ID
