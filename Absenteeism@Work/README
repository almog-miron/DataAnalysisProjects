Employee Absenteeism Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes employee absenteeism data using SQL and Power BI. The goal was to uncover absenteeism patterns, design a fair bonus distribution strategy, and create an interactive dashboard to support HR decision-making.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************

Highlights:

SQL Data Preparation

Joined absence, reasons, and compensation tables.

Identified healthiest employees with below-average absenteeism for potential bonuses.

Calculated a transparent bonus distribution for non-smokers (~$1,400 per year per employee).

Built a clean dataset for Power BI.

Power BI Dashboard

Absenteeism by reason, season, and lifestyle factors.

Trends across BMI categories, smoking/drinking habits, and compensation.

Interactive HR-focused visualizations for identifying absenteeism drivers.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************

Key Insights

Non-smokers and non-drinkers with healthy BMI are absent significantly less.

Seasonal absenteeism peaks in winter.

Transparent, data-driven bonus allocation can improve fairness and motivation.
