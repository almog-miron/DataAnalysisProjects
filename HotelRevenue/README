SQL + Power BI: Hotel Revenue Analysis
üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel revenue and operational data from two hotels over the years 2018‚Äì2020 using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization.
The analysis focuses on:

Year-over-year revenue growth

Potential need for increasing parking lot size

Seasonal and trend patterns in Average Daily Rate (ADR) and guest behavior

The end goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for hotel management.
