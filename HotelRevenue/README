SQL + Power BI: Hotel Revenue Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel revenue and operational data from two hotels over the years 2018–2020 using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization.
The analysis focuses on:

Year-over-year revenue growth

Potential need for increasing parking lot size

Seasonal and trend patterns in Average Daily Rate (ADR) and guest behavior

The end goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for hotel management.

📂 Data Source

The dataset consists of three yearly Excel sheets:

2018$

2019$

2020$

Each sheet contains records of hotel stays, revenue metrics, and operational details (e.g., ADR, parking spaces, stay duration).

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server – Data cleaning, aggregation, and querying

Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization (in progress)

Excel – Initial data source storage
